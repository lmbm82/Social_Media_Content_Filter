# Social Media Content Filtering with AI

This project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook with the goal of building an AI-based content moderation system for social media platforms.

## Technologies

 - Python
 - NLTK (VADER Sentiment Analysis)
 - Regular Expressions (re)
 - Jupyter Notebook

## Description

The system analyzes text content to detect:

 - Offensive language
 - Extremely negative sentiment
 - Heavily reported content by users

It also simulates explicit image detection.
Based on these rules, the system automatically decides whether content should be approved, flagged for human review, or removed.

## Result

 - The project demonstrates how rule-based logic combined with sentiment analysis can be used to build an effective and interpretable AI content moderation pipeline.
